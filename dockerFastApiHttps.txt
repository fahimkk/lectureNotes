DockerFile  - inside this file, we can write the codes for docker
.dockerignore - same as .gitignore

Create docker imgage
$ docker build -t app ./
-t means the type of the image (name, here app) and ./ means do it on this local directory

after creating docker image to run the container with the docker image
$ docker run -it -p 5000:80 app
-it means interactive terminal (this will shows what happening inside the container into the terminal)
-p for port. 5000 in local machine and 80 in container.

we can create a docker-compose.yml file to store all the settings 
after that we can simply start the docker by
$ docker-compose up

# install docker compose 
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

docker-compose --version


#1
docker-compose.yml
version: "3"
services:
  backend:
    build: ./
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 80:80

when 1 works fine, use the 2 nd one, and also run with trafaek

# run with traefik
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up

# if it shows network not found error
$ docker network create traefik-public
( or $ docker network create --driver=overlay traefik-public)
then run again the previous command


# to run in demond mode, ie in background
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.traefik.yml up -d

# so traefik keeps in background, now run with docker-compose.yml (2nd file)
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up -d
